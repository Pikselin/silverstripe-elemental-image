An elemental block with an image and caption.

Features:
- allows for an image, alt text and caption
- uses responsive images (picture tags) via the `heyday/silverstripe-responsive-images` module
- includes CSS that can be easily overridden
- includes an extension for the controller that does the requirements call for the CSS.
- adds an alt text field to the image object via the `purplespider/asset-alt-text` module
